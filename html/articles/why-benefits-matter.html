            I opened my usual news and social media feeds one day--this was some time in October of 2021--one phrase stuck out: The Great Resignation. Apparently, it has been a hot topic in certain circles for the past three months. Why were millions of American workers resigning during a pandemic? It sounded blatantly counterintuitive for a Filipino like myself.
            <br><br>
            As I approach the wiser-but-still-young age of 50, this puzzle lingered in my mind for a few days. Growing up in our culture, “saving for a rainy day” meant more than keeping some money in the bank. It involved spending “blood, sweat and tears” in any work you can find that can keep food on the table and a roof above our heads. After all, aren’t we the country most known for sending our workers abroad, away from their families and often into difficult situations just to keep our economy going? Can this American trend reach our shores like almost everything else?
            <br><br>
            I think their situations differ from ours. Compared to the Philippines, Americans enjoy relatively more safety nets or parachutes from their in times of unemployment. While they enjoy parachutes, when faced with unemployment Filipinos will feel like jumping from a plane with an umbrella. Our social security and health insurance provides minimal assurance that they can support us throughout the unemployment period.
            <br><br>
            What the pandemic will bring about though is the realization that being with family is just as important as work. How many months have we been unable to get out? And while employees do worry about our income, most employees have also come to recognize certain needs of  their families that may previously have been overlooked. Does this mean they will leave their jobs and stay at home when the pandemic is over? For most people, I don’t think so. But it changes the entire equation of how we value our work against our personal needs. The non-monetary value of “home” increases against the often just monetary value of work.
            <br><br>
            “Saving for a rainy day” will no longer be just about the money saved. The time employees spend at work will have to take on new meaning to them. Remember, employees have always been saving for a future and not for a fat bank account, but somehow over the years everything got to be represented by the paycheck. This is where employee benefits help both employers and employees.
            <br><br>
            I will not delve into the details of each type of benefit in this post, but let’s assume that everyone has at least a minimal understanding of basic employee benefits since employees already enjoy basic mandated benefits of social security and PhilHealth.
            <br><br>
            As employees go through this change in perspective, employers have to recognize it too. Except for the most money-driven people, an average employer will see it even through themselves and their families. After all is said and done, we all worked for our quality of life and our families’ future.
            <br><br>
            Before the turn of the millennium, we often heard the phrase “nobody is indispensable” in the workplace. I do not hear it nowadays, except from old people. But not being a wealthy economy, we can't deny that the Philippines has a surplus of workforce that may have contributed to this idea that anybody can be replaced, anytime. But while I may want to keep my job, it doesn't necessarily mean that I'm happy and productive. I'll dare to say it's likely the same with hundreds of other employees.
            <br><br>
            Employee benefits are viable means to keep employees happy. They are legitimate incentives that help employees and their families, and in the case of insurance and pension plans, something they can look forward to supplementing their retirement. Benefits also communicate an assurance that an employer cares about his employees. Not only will employees value their jobs, they will value the company and treat it as a second family.
            <br><br>
            They are not expensive. Not offering benefits to employees may seem like the cheaper option, initially. But sickness and even death are unavoidable realities every employee faces which are more expensive to deal with if the employee is paying for them directly, than with the help of HMO or insurance. On the part of the employer, the reality is that happy employees stay and unhappy ones go. It is more costly to replace good, qualified employees. For growing companies or companies with large head count, the cost of benefits per employee further decreases.
            <br><br>
            Given new opportunities, employees will also compare their present situation with the opportunity offered to them. Thus a good overall compensation package coupled with a workplace that cares possesses a distinct advantage over an I-just-need-this-job-for-income situation.
            <br><br>
            So, while Filipino employees won’t throw away employment, they will continue to seek better places to work. Benefits covers a lot of bases in this respect, and may go a long way in keeping business sustainable and employee-friendly.
